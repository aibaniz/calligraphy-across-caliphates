## Meet the Team

*Calligraphy Across the Caliphates* was developed by a collaborative team of junior researchers within the Seminar for Arabic Studies at Freie Universität Berlin. The project explores Islamic art through the lens of digital humanities, with a focus on accessibility, historical accuracy, and visual storytelling.
