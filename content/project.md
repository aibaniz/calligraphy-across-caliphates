## About the Project

This digital humanities project explores the evolution, style, and geographical spread of Islamic calligraphy from the 7th to the 19th century. 

Our goal is to provide an accessible, visual, and scholarly overview of various calligraphic traditions across regions and time periods.

This site combines academic research with digital tools to make the richness of Islamic calligraphy visible to broader audiences.
